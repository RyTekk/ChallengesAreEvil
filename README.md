...no, seriously. "Don't die on ARAM" challenge? That's called griefing, Riot.


## Functionality

- Remove your challenge tokens from profile banner.

*Note: when you remove tokens with identity customization window open (icons, tokens, titles) then closing that window will overwrite tokens and set them back to what they were before.*

**WARNING!** The app can only reset tokens. It does not break anything and can't be bugged - it will either work or it won't. If something doesn't work after clearing tokens then it is because Riot made the client work that way. Apparently you need to select tokens in order. You can't select middle token only. You have to select left then middle then right. The app has nothing to do with this and it is Riot decision to make it work that way.

## Will I get banned? Is it legit?

The answer is most likely (99.99%) you won't get banned. The app uses built-in functionality of the client. It does not modify anything in the client. It interacts with the client telling it to do stuff and the client does everything itself. As of 2022-10-18 there were no reports of anyone getting banned.

## App flagged as virus!

Some anti-viruses detect the app as some generic virus. It is obviously false positive. More info and checksums here https://github.com/MaciejGorczyca/ChallengesAreEvil/issues/8. If in doubt - compile and build the app yourself OR follow this step-by-step guide https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/w91xqk/patch_1214_bug_megathread/iip126n/
